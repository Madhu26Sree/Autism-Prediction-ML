**ABSTRACT **
Autism Spectrum Syndrome (ASS) is basically a type of developmental disorder where a person 
faces challenges in social communication, interacting with others, and often shows repeated or 
fixed patterns in their behavior, interests, or daily activities. But early diagnosis is super 
important because if it’s detected in time, proper care and support can really make an immense 
change in one’s life. Many researchers have already tried different Machine Learning (ML) 
methods like Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine to predict autism. 
But still, making an accurate prediction is a difficult task because autism symptoms vary from 
person to person. In this project, the main aim was to build a reliable autism prediction model 
using a mix of ML and Deep Learning (DL) techniques. For this, I have used a publicly 
available dataset from Kaggle which contains details like age, answers to some basic questions, 
and a score based on them. Some ML models such as Decision Tree, Random Forest, CatBoost, 
and LightGBM were applied. Along with that, DL  models like LSTM and BiLSTM were also 
used to improve the performance. The unique part of this work is that it combines both 
traditional ML models with DL models for better accuracy. After analyzing the models based 
on accuracy, precision and F1-score, it was found that BiLSTM gave the most accurate results.
